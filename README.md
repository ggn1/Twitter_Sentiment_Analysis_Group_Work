# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains documents demonstrating code and other related content to a group project undertaken as part of Heriot-Watt University's Applied Text Analytics (F20AA) course under its BSc. Computer Science (Honours) program. The aim of the project was to retrieve and analyze Tweets related to Expo 2020 held in Dubai, UAE. ML tools were then employed to try and predict polarity of sentiment associated with the Tweets.

Note: Since this project was group work, as a fellow team member, I am not entitled to share data used or our python notebook files publically. So, please find pdfs that demonstrates our work instead. I'd like to implore the reader to kindly refrain from downloading, sharing or publishing this material.
